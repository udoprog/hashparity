Copy hashparity to somewhere in your path:

    cp hashparity /usr/local/bin/

Create a .hash at the root of the directory you want to check

    mkdir .hash

Run the parity check:

    hashparity .

Exit status will be 1 if any files does not match, the initial run will probably just create a bunch of files.
